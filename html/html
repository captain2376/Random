SELECTORS

    -tag SELECTORS we can target an element with the help of tag 
    <style>
    li{
        color:blue;
    }
    </style>
    <style>
    h1{
        color:red
    }
    </style>
    it will change all the tags with h1 into red color
    body{},....

    -class SELECTORS
    add class attribite to the tage you want to target
    class-"target1"
    in head style section
    <style>
    .target1{
        #this is the selector for class and you edit it as you like
    }
    </style>

-id selectors allow you to add an id to an element and then style it
#idname{
    attributename:attributeValue;
}

HTML code can have multiple class selectors but only one ID SELECTOR**
