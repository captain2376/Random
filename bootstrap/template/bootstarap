BOOTSTRAP : is the popular html,css and javascript framework for developing 
a responsive and mobile-friendly website
<div class="container">
    //for webistes with left and right equal margin
</div>
<div class="container-fluid">
    //for full page webistes   
</div>

BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM 
 bootstrap grid  allows to structure the layout that are mobile-friendly too

<div class="row">
    //____________________________this is row in bootstrap___________
    horizontal space bar
    in a row there are total 12 grids
    //1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_10_11_12
-when we create a row bootstrap provides us 12 grids.

</div>
we have an image and text -both of them should cover 50% and 50%
now in bootstrap we divide row into 6-image,6-text (6,6-cols)
we can also divide these 12 cols into different pairs(1,1,..)(2,2,)(3,3,3,3),(4,4,4)(3,5,4),..as needed
